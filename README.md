# CALCULATOR PROJECT - Version 1 (6 August 2017)

## Task

We were asked to build a simple calculator program in our first week of learning Ruby.

## Synopsis

The program asks the user for two numbers. It then gives them the option to type 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide' (and error checking has been built in so that this process is looped whenever the user enters in something other than those given options.) 

The program then calculates the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of the two numbers (the first number being the base number). The numbers are floats in order to take into account decimal places.

## Further Work

The user should be able to enter more than just two numbers, and each time a calculation is made, the answer should be temporarily stored before the next calculation is done to it. For example, 3 + 4 = 7, so the 7 should be stored, and the user given the option to continue their calculation, such as 7 / 2 = 3.5. This should continue on loop until the user decides they wish to end the calculation.
